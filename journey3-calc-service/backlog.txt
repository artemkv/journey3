DONE:
- install local DynamoDB and try local invocation
- function versioning - new version for every deploy. See here: https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions#versioning-deployed-functions
- specify good bucket name - can do using "deploymentBucket", but then it needs to exist
- refer to SQS from cloudformation
- configure correct timeouts, batching etc.

TODO:
- seed the table with allowed apps
- templating? Basically how to deploy the same function but with different config to run in different environment
